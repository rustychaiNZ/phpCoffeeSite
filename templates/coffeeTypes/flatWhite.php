				<h2 class="section">Flat White</h2>
				<p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency). It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency â€“ allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk.</p>
